### Why I choose to do an Android app?
Android is a software system which is widely used on different types of devices, there is a great demand for using Android app.

 ### Challenges that I experienced: 
 - UI/framework design
 - Display the data after fetching from backend server

 ### Tech tools:
 - Google Firebase:
   - Provide Real-time Database. (Baed on Nosql, updating data in milliseconds)
   - Provide Offlin cache, prevent from losing data
   - Use Firebase Authentication, enhanve the data security for users
   - Fribase Message System - live updates
   
 - Goolge Map View
   - The app is integrated with Google Map view. Increase the speed of developing by taking advantage of using it.
   
### Some basic concepts
- Four basic components of Android
  - Activity (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity)
  - Service (https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services)
  - Broadcast Receiver (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)
  - Content Provider (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers)

- Layout design
  - In Andorid, XML(Extensible Markup Language) is used to design layout, because XML is a lightweight language.
  - In this "smart driving" program, Java is used to provide logic.
